ttBrowserBot: A turntable.fm bot that runs in your browser.
The bot was originally created for Top40, but it's now open-source. 

Based on:
https://github.com/potatono/topicbot.

To use this bot directly do a DOM injection using Firefox or Chrome while in your turntable room of choice..
Here's a bookmarklet:
javascript:$.getScript('https://raw.github.com/ttdevelopers/ttbrowserbot/master/topicbot.js');

For best results, just fork this repo and edit topicbot.js to your room's needs!

Enjoy,
The ttDevelopers Team
